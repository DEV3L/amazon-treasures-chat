### Problem

Users often find it challenging to navigate through Amazon’s vast product catalog due to its sheer size and complexity. Traditional search methods can be time-consuming and may not always yield relevant results, leading to a frustrating shopping experience. Moreover, developers face difficulties in leveraging structured data for conversational AI applications, owing to limitations in data types, sizes, and efficient retrieval mechanisms. Amazon Treasures Chat aims to address these issues by providing a conversational interface for easy product discovery and tracking, along with a streamlined process for developers to manage and deploy AI assistants effectively.

### North Star

The North Star for Amazon Treasures Chat is centered around two main metrics: user engagement and accuracy of the conversational AI. User engagement will be measured by metrics such as daily active users, session length, and the number of items tracked per user. This reflects the application’s ability to provide a compelling, useful service that attracts and retains users. The accuracy of the conversational AI, on the other hand, will be quantified through the relevance of search results, the successful execution of user commands (e.g., tracking items, refining searches), and user satisfaction ratings. Achieving high marks in these areas will indicate that Amazon Treasures Chat is fulfilling its promise to revolutionize the way users interact with Amazon’s product catalog, making every search a seamless, engaging experience.
